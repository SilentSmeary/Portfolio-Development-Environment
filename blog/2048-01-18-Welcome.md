Welcome, this is my first blog post. I' m currently a student at UTC Leeds studing the Design and Development Digital T Level. As part of the course we have been given some old enterprise hardware from another school that were no longer using it anymore. I install took interest in the installation of services and the deployment of self hosted services. 

As part of the new servers that we had got our hands on we decided that we were going to run our own domain group for the sandbox machines that I will talk about later and for the Raspberry Pi5 that we also invested in more about that later.
