Welcome, this is my first blog post. I' m currently a student at UTC Leeds studing the Design and Development Digital T Level. As part of the course we have been given some old enterprise hardware from another school that were no longer using it anymore. I install took interest in the installation of services and the deployment of self hosted services. 

As part of the new servers that we had got our hands on we decided that we were going to run our own domain group for the sandbox machines that I will talk about later and for the Raspberry Pi5 that we also invested in more about that later. We planned that most of the machines were going to be running windows so we decided that it would be the best option to go for Windows Server 2019, It would have been nice to got for an newer more recent version of the operating system for the security patches and the new features. But due to the old hardware we met issues with the Fujitsu Raid card not been compatible with the Windows Server 2022 Builds.
