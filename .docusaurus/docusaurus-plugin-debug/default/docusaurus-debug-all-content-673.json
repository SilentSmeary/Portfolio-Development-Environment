For this project we worked with Leeds City Council and Hundo\r\n\r\nHundo's project was to provide digital work experience to Digital Students such as our selfs. So it made for a perfect opportunity to work and gain connections with external companies as well as completing 10 of our 45 days\r\n\r\n### The brief\r\nOver the course of the next 5 weeks, you will work with hundo to design, build and promote a product for Leeds City Council. YOu will be working with the hudno team, and the Employment and Skills team from Leeds City Council. \r\n\r\n### Product requirements\r\nLeeds City Council wanted to make an emmersive experience that showcased all the exhibitors that visted Leeds Apprenticeship Requirement Fair 2024 into and online experience so that people that went able to travel into the centre of leeds for the face to face event. Also that users we're able to access all the information that they needed if they were interested in applying for an apprenticship \r\n\r\n### My Role\r\n\r\nDuring the project we were split into groups to tackle the project and make it more manageable and organised so that we could work independantly and get the tasks done\r\n\r\nWe were given a Google Drive with all of them employers and a spreadsheet with there information. Firstly we made sure that all of our assets were in the correct format and were right for the spatial program that we used once we had made sure that all of the assets followed the quide lines we started adding them into the world. WSe made sure that all the assets were spaced out roughly to make sure that the space was clear and everything was easy to view for all the people that were involved\r\n\r\n### Final Products\r\n- [Hundo](https://Hundo.xyz) \r\n- [Leeds City Council](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/)\r\n- [UTC Leeds](https://www.utcleeds.co.uk/)\r\n- [Leeds City College](https://leedscitycollege.ac.uk/)\r\n- [Jack](https://github.com/gxlxzzzz)\r\n- [LARF 2024 Hub](https://www.spatial.io/s/LARF24-The-Online-Edition-65b798bf5e7e990cda4c3ca8)\r\n- [Construction Area](https://spatial.io/s/Construction-65ae2f68cec4e3df5917c10e?share=6692365276193958705)"

          "content": "### Introduction\r\nWe needed a safe fast and secure solution for storage. We need a solution that supported both Windows Shares (SMB) and Linux Shares. With the requirements that we need and the hardware that we have the search began. For the OS that was compatible with our older hardware and that worked with newish drives that were harvested from our old college machines that were no longer in use.\r\n\r\n### Final Choice\r\nAfter a few days searching and countless failed attempts to deploy a working server we found TrueNAS Scale and Core. After looking into the documentation for both of them. We found that it was not viable for use TrueNAS Scale as it ment we needed two boot drives this would have made the machines more redundant incase of a drive failure. For a long term solution this would have been much more viable. But we didnt not have the drive bays aviable for the space that we wanted. As the server only had 6 bays we decided to go for the TrueNAS Core which required us to have one boot drive. Which was perfect for our situation.\r\n\r\n### Hardware Specs\r\nThe server chasis is a Fujitsu RX300 S7. On the front of the server there are 6 SATA ports in the front of the server. That are connect with a SAS connected to the PCIE Raid Card on the motherboard. The server has two CPUs both `Intel Xeon E5-2620` with 12 cores and 24 threads. We decided to make the server have as much memory as we had available this was to make sure that we were able to set the RAM and the primary cache so that the drives could handle the max efficenty possible and always be running and handling data the fastest possible speed. `192GB DDR3 1066 mhz` memory.\r\n\r\n### Installation Process\r\n:::tip\r\nCheck the official **TrueNAS** Documentation for more support!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.truenas.com/docs/\r\n:::\r\n\r\nThe installation process was mostly normal there was no major hickups with the installation. Once the OS was installed the first hurdle was fighting with the network card. I wanted to make sure that we had the fastest Network Card to make sure that users were able to upload larger files at the the same time and not stress the network attempting the tasks. The servers came with the added network card by standard when they arrvied. We had the 2 ports that were standard to the motherboard, there was then two ports that were added with one of the extra network cards. We had another network card that added four more ports. There was one more network card that added two SFP ports. that we were not set up to use effectively so I decided to take that extra card out of the server to reduce the slots that showed up on there already. From there it was configurating the network, I had assigned the Static IP to the right port and made sure that the port was given the network by checking the network link lights on the network card. They were both flashing to indicate that the network was connected and authenticated. I attempted to connect to the website and recived the first error of the day. The IP was inaccessable. From there we spent two to three days attempting to fix the network errors with no outcome we decided that the best choice was to setup a DHCP pool on our VLAN to get DHCP to hand out and IP to give us the correct networking information, which allowed for straight connection. This allowed for us to make the connection and then change the IP on the socket to be a Static IP to make deployment much easier\r\n\r\n### Storage Drives\r\n```\r\n1x 240GB Kingston SSD [BOOT]\r\n5x 480GB Kingston SSD [STORAGE] \r\n```"
