  "description": "We wanted to make sure that there was plenty of space for file storage for the users that were using the new Domain. So we decided that a seperate server handling data would be the best. We decided to host the TrueNAS on a seperate physical machine this would ensure that if there was a failure on one machine that any data that was stored on the server would not be lost and would be stored else where.",
